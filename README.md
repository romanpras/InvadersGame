# InvadersGame

Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player controls a spaceship by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. 
The aim is to defeat seven rows of ten aliens.

The player uses the spaceship to explosion an alien he gets a score and the more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. 
Defeating all the aliens on-screen brings level up difficult.

The aliens try to destroy the players' spaceship by firing bullets as they approach the bottom of the screen. 
The game continues until all the aliens are defeated or if the alien reaches the bottom of the screen, then the game is over.

The player can be disqualified up to 3 times and then there is an announcement of the end of the game.
